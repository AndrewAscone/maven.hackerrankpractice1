* I had to take an array of integers, add 2 of the indices and add the sum to the array.
* and do that as many times until there is 1 number left in the array
* for example.
  * input = `[1,2,3,4]`.
  * `1+2 =  3`... so new array would be `[3,4,3]`... then
  * `3+4 =  7`... so new array would be `[3,7]`... then
  * `3+7 = 10`... so you are left with `[10]`
* but then you had to return the sum of the sums. so
  * `3 + 7 + 10 = 20`
